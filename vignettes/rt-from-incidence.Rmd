# Introduction

If we have estimated the incidence of a disease $I_t$ using a poisson rate using
maximum likelihood estimators, the rate is typically a log-normally distributed
with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$. Such a fitted model is shown below on a log1p
scale, for the COVID-19 epidemic in England:

```{r}

raw = growthrates::england_covid %>%
  time_aggregate(count=sum(count))

fit = raw %>% poisson_locfit_model()

plot_incidence(fit,raw, colour="blue",size=0.025,events = england_events)+
  scale_y_log1p()+
  coord_cartesian(xlim=as.Date(c("2020-01-01","2023-01-01")))
```

It is appealing to use this modelled incidence estimate to calculate an estimate
of the reproduction number, $R_t$. Incidence models can be derived in a number
of ways, they are easily inspected for error and can be made tolerant of missing
values and outliers. 

# Methods

To use a modelled estimate of incidence to predict $R_t$ we
need to propagate uncertainty in incidence into our $R_t$ estimates. To
calculate $R_t$ we can use the backwards-looking renewal equations which
incorporate the infectivity profile of the disease ($\omega$) at a number of
days after infection ($\tau$):


$$
I_t \sim Lognormal(\mu_t,\sigma_t) \\
R_t = \frac{I_t}{\sum_{\tau}{\omega_{\tau}I_{t-\tau}}}
$$

giving us:

$$
R_t = \frac{Lognormal(\mu_t,\sigma_t)}{\sum_{\tau}{
  Lognormal( \mu_{t-\tau} + log(\omega_{\tau}) , \sigma_{t-\tau})
}} \\
$$


The sum of $i$ such log normal distributions can be approximated by another log
normal (Lo 2013) with parameters $\mu_Z$ and $\sigma_Z$.

$$
\begin{align}
	S_+ &= \operatorname{E}\left[\sum_i X_i \right] = \sum_i 
	\operatorname{E}[X_i] = 
	\sum_i e^{\mu_i + \sigma_i^2/2}
	\\
	\sigma^2_{Z} &= 1/S_+^2 \, \sum_{i,j}
	  \operatorname{cor}_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j \operatorname{E}[X_i] \operatorname{E}[X_j] =
	  1/S_+^2 \, \sum_{i,j}
	  \operatorname{cor}_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j e^{\mu_i+\sigma_i^2/2} 
	  e^{\mu_j+\sigma_j^2/2} 
	\\
	\mu_Z &= \ln\left( S_+ \right) - \sigma_{Z}^2/2 
\end{align}
$$

The sum term in the denominator of the renewal equations consists of a set of
correlated scaled log normal distributions with both scale and correlation
defined by the infectivity profile ($\omega$). In our case $cor_{ij}$ can be
equated to the infectivity profile ($\omega_{|i-j|}$) when $i \neq j$ and 1 when
$i = j$. $\mu_i$ is $\mu_{t-\tau} + ln(\omega_{\tau})$.


$$
\begin{align}
	S_{t} &= \sum_{s=1}^{|\omega|} { \omega_s e^{\mu_{t-s} + \sigma_{t-s}^2/2 }} \\
	\sigma_{Z,t} &= \sqrt{
	  \frac{
	    \sum_{i,j=1}^{|\omega|} {
  	    (\omega_{|i-j|}+I(i,j)) \omega_i \omega_j (\sigma_{(t-i)} e^{\mu_{(t-i)}+\sigma_{(t-i)}^2/2}) (\sigma_{(t-j)} e^{\mu_{(t-j)}+\sigma_{(t-j)}^2/2)} 
	    }
	  }{S_{t}^2}
	}	\\
	\mu_{Z,t} &= \log\left( S_{t} \right) - \sigma_{Z,t}^2/2 
\end{align}
$$

$\mu$ is the central estimate of case counts on the log scale, and its standard
deviation can also be large. There are numerical stability issues dealing
with terms involving $e^{(\mu+\sigma^2)}$, however keeping everything in log space and 
using optimised log-sum-exp functions this can be made computationally tractable.

$$
\begin{align}
	\log(S_{t}) &= \log(\sum_{s=1}^{|\omega|} {  e^{\mu_{t-s} + \sigma_{t-s}^2/2 + \log(\omega_s) }}) \\
	\log(T_{t,\tau}) &= \log(\omega_{\tau}) + \log(\sigma_{(t-{\tau})}) + \mu_{(t-{\tau})} + \sigma_{(t-{\tau})}^2/2) \\
	\log(cor_{i,j}) &= \log(\omega_{|i-j|}+I(i=j)) \\
	\log(\sigma_{Z,t}^2) &= \log(
	    \sum_{i,j=1}^{|\omega|} {
  	      e^{
  	        \log(cor_{i,j}) + \log(T_{t,i}) + \log(T_{t,j})
  	      }
	    }) - 2 \log(S_{t}) \\
	\mu_{Z,t} &= \log( S_{t} ) - \sigma_{Z,t}^2/2 
\end{align}
$$

N.B. if we assume the individual estimates of the incidence are uncorrelated this
simplifies to:

$$
\begin{align}
\log(\sigma_{Z,t}^2) &= \log(
	    \sum_{\tau=1}^{|\omega|} {
  	      e^{
  	        2 \log(T_{t,\tau})
  	      }
	    }) - 2 \log(S_{t})
\end{align}
$$

Empirically there is not a huge amount of difference in estimates between these
two forms. If the infectivity profile $\omega$ is spread out over a large period
then the correlation matrix will be $O(\omega)^2$ which may predicate this simpler
order 1 formulation.

With $\mu_{Z,t}$ and $\sigma_{Z,t}$ we are left with the final derivation of
$R_t$, giving us a distributional form of $R_t$ incorporating uncertainty from
modelled incidence estimates:

$$
\begin{align}
R_t &= \frac{Lognormal(\mu_t,\sigma_t)}
{Lognormal( \mu_{Z,t}, \sigma_{Z,t})} \\
\mu_{R_t} &= \mu_t - \mu_{Z,t} \\
\sigma_{R_t} &= \sqrt{\sigma_t^2+\sigma_{z,t}^2} \\
R_t &= Lognormal(\mu_{R_t}, \sigma_{R_t})
\end{align}
$$

This is conditioned on a single known infectivity profile. In reality there is
also uncertainty in the infectivity profile, however we cannot assume any
particular distributional form for this. We can use a range of empirical
estimates of the infectivity profile to calculate multiple distributional
estimates for $R_t$ and then combine these as a mixture distribution
numerically. To avoid the computation involved however a reasonable
approximation for the mixture is a log normal with the same mean and variance as
the mixture, as it is likely the individual $R_t$ estimates will be all very
similar. This moment matching should be done using the mean and variance of the
$R_t$ distributions and not the log transformed distribution parameters, $\mu$
and $\sigma$:

$$
\begin{align}
E[R_t] &= e^{(\mu_{R_t} - \sigma_{R_t}^2/2)} \\
Var[R_t] &= \big[
  e^{(\sigma_{R_t}^2)} - 1
\big] \big[
  e^{2 \mu_{R_t} + \sigma_{R_t}^2}
\big] \\
E[R_t^*] &= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} E[{R_t|\omega}] \\
Var[R_t^*] &= \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \bigg(\sum_{\omega \in \Omega}{Var[R_t|\omega]+E[R_t|\omega]^2}\bigg) - E[R_t^*]^2 \\
\mu^* &= \log\Bigg(\frac{E[R_t^*]}{\sqrt{\frac{Var[R_t^*]}{E[R_t^*]^2}+1}}\Bigg)  \\
\sigma_*^2 &= \log\bigg(\frac{Var[R_t^*]}{E[R_t^*]^2}+1\bigg)\\
R_t^* &= Lognormal(\mu_*,\sigma_*) 
\end{align}
$$

# Implementation

This method is implemented using the following R function, which is designed
for numerical stability and speed. Generating $R_t$ estimates given modelled 
incidence typically occurring in:

```{r}
print(growthrates:::.internal_r_t_estim)
```

# Results

Testing this against the incidence model shown above, and comparing the results
to the SPI-M-O consensus $R_t$ estimates gives us the following time-series for
England. This has not been formally evaluated but qualitatively is a good fit. This 
single time series with 1410 time points took around 3 seconds to fit, which opens
up the possibility of performing $R_t$ estimates in fine grained geographical 
or demographic subgroups.

```{r}

system.time({
  rt_fit = fit %>% growthrates::rt_from_incidence(ip = covid_infectivity_profile)
})

plot_rt(rt_fit, events = england_events, colour="blue")+
  coord_cartesian(xlim=as.Date(c("2020-01-01","2023-01-01")), ylim=c(0.6,1.6))+
  geom_errorbar(data=england_consensus_rt,aes(x=date-14,ymin=low,ymax=high),colour="red")

```

# Conclusion

We present a methodology for deriving $R_t$ from modelled estimates of incidence
while propagating uncertainty. We demonstrate it produces satisfactory
qualitative results against COVID-19 data. This method is relatively quick,
fully deterministic, and can be used on top of any statistical models for
estimating incidence which use logarithmic link functions.
