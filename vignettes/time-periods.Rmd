`growthrates` assumes a consistent naming scheme for significant columns,
notably `time` and `count`, and additionally `class`, `denom`, `population`
columns. Data needs to be supplied using these column names and to make sure the
data is formatted correctly it undergoes quite rigorous checks. One area where
this can pose problems is in correct grouping, which must make sure that each
group is a single time series of unique `time` and minimally `count` columns.

# Line lists vs. time series

Infectious disease data usually either comes as a set of observations of an
individual infection with a time stamp (i.e. a line list) or as a count of
events (e.g. positive tests, hospitalisations, deaths) happening within a
specific period (day, week, month etc.) as a time series.

For count data there may also be a denominator known. For testing this could be
the number of tests performed, or the number of patients at risk of
hospitalisation.

For both these data types there may also be a class associated with each
observation, defining a subgroup of infections of interest. This could be the
variant of a virus, or the age group, for example. It may make sense to compare
these different subgroups against each other. In this case the denominator may
be the total of counts among all groups per unit time. Additionally there may be
information about the size of the population for each subgroup.

`growthrates` assumes for the most part that the input data is in the form of
a set of time series of counts, each of which has a unique set of times, which
are usually complete. To create datasets like this from line lists `growthrates`
provides some infrastructure for dealing with time series:

# Time periods

A weekly case rate represents a time slice of seven days with a start and finish
date. Dates are a continuous quantity, and `cut_dates()` can be used to classify
continuous dates into periods of equal duration, with a start date:

```{r}
random_dates = Sys.Date()+sample.int(21,50,replace = TRUE)
cut_date( random_dates, unit = "1 week", anchor = "start", dfmt = "%d %b")
```

Performing calculations using interval censored dates is awkward. A numeric
version of dates is useful that can keep track of both the start date of a time
series and its intrinsic duration, as a numeric. This is the purpose of the
`time_period` class:

```{r}
dates = seq(as.Date("2020-01-01"),by=7,length.out = 5)
tmp = as.time_period(dates)
tmp
```

The `time_period` defaults to using a date at the beginning of the COVID-19 
pandemic as its origin and calculating a duration unit based on the data (in this
case weekly).

A usual set of S3 methods are available such as formatting, printing, labelling,
and casting `time_period`s to and from dates and POSIXct classes:

```{r}
suppressWarnings(labels(tmp))
```

A weekly time series can be recast to a different frequency, or start date:

```{r}

tmp2 = as.time_period(tmp, unit = "2 days", start_date = "2020-01-01")
tmp2

```

and the original dates should be recoverable:

```{r}
as.Date(tmp2)
```

`date_seq()` can be used to make sure a set of periodic times is complete:

```{r}

tmp3 = as.time_period(Sys.Date()+c(0:2,4:5)*7,anchor = "start")
as.Date(date_seq(tmp3))

```

`time_periods` can be used with any monthly or yearly data but such data are not
regular. This is handled and irregular date periods are generally OK to use with
`growthrates` but some functions like `date_seq` may not work as anticipated
with irregular dates.

Two time series can be aligned to make them comparable:

```{r}

orig_dates = Sys.Date()+1:10*7

# a 2 daily time series based on weekly dates
t1 = as.time_period(orig_dates, unit = "2 days", start_date = "2021-01-01")
t1

# a weekly with different start date
t2 = as.time_period(orig_dates, unit = "1 week", start_date = "2022-01-01")
t2

# rebase t1 into the same format as t2
# as t1 and t2 based on the same original dates converting t2 onto the same
# peridicty as t1 results in an identical set of times
t3 = as.time_period(t1,t2)
t3
```

# Times in `growthrates` and conversion of line-lists

`growthrates` uses the `time_period` class internally extensively. Casting dates
to and from `time_periods` is all that generally needs to be done before using 
`growthrates`. Most of the functions in `growthrates` operate on time series data
which expect a unique (and usually complete) set of data on a periodic time.

To help prepare line-list data into time series there is the `time_summarise()` 
function. A minimal line-list will have a date column and nothing else.


```{r}

random_dates = Sys.Date()+sample.int(21,50,replace = TRUE)
linelist = tibble::tibble(date = random_dates)
linelist %>% time_summarise(unit="1 week") %>% dplyr::glimpse()

```

If the line-list contains a `class` column it is interpreted as a complete
record of all possible options from which we can calculate a denominator. In
this case the positive and negative results of a test:

```{r}

random_dates = Sys.Date()+sample.int(21,200,replace = TRUE)
linelist2 = tibble::tibble(
  date = random_dates,
  class = stats::rbinom(200, 1, 0.04) %>% ifelse("positive","negative")
)
linelist2 %>% time_summarise(unit="1 week") %>% dplyr::glimpse()


```

In this specific example subsequent analysis with `growthrates` may focus on the 
`positive` subgroup only, as the comparison between `positive` and `negative` test results is trivial. In another example `class` may not be test results, it could be any other major subdivision e.g. the variant of a disease. In this case the 
comparison between different groups may be much more relevant. The use of
`class` as the major sub-group is for convenience. Additional grouping other
than `class` columns is also possible for multi-facetted comparisons, and
grouping is preserved but not included automatically in the denominator, which
may need to be manually calculated:

```{r}

random_dates = Sys.Date()+sample.int(21,200,replace = TRUE)
variant = apply(stats::rmultinom(200, 1, c(0.1,0.3,0.6)), MARGIN = 2, function(x) which(x==1))

linelist3 = tibble::tibble(
  date = random_dates,
  class = c("variant1","variant2","variant3")[variant],
  gender = ifelse(stats::rbinom(200,1,0.5),"male","female")
)
  
count_by_gender = linelist3 %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(gender) %>% 
  time_summarise(unit="1 week") %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(time, gender, class) %>%
  dplyr::glimpse()

```

# Aggregating time series datasets.

In the case of a time series with additional grouping present, removing a level
of grouping whilst retaining time is made easier with `time_aggregate()`. In
this case we wish to sum `count` and `denom` by gender, retaining the class
grouping.

```{r}

count_by_gender %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(class,gender) %>% 
  time_aggregate() %>%
  dplyr::glimpse()

```

by default `time_aggregate` will sum any of `count`, `denom` and `population`
columns but any other behaviour can be specified by passing `dplyr::summarise`
style directives to the function.
