## Background

Collection of tools from COVID-19 with focus on simplicity with a goal
to provide a simple pipeline from data to visualisation. The main
features are listed below. The documentation is in development. For the
time being the best resources are the other vignettes including:

-   `vignette("covid-timeseries",package="ggoutbreak")`
-   `vignette("incidence-trends",package="ggoutbreak")`
-   `vignette("variant-proportions",package="ggoutbreak")`


## Installation

`ggoutbreak` is hosted on the [AI4CI r-universe](https://ai4ci.r-universe.dev/).
Installation from there is as follows:

``` r
options(repos = c(
  "ai4ci" = 'https://ai4ci.r-universe.dev/',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Download and install ggoutbreak in R
install.packages("ggoutbreak")
```

You can install the development version of `ggoutbreak` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ai4ci/ggoutbreak) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ai4ci/ggoutbreak")
```

## Features

Simulation

-   Poisson (aggregate count) & branching process (line list)
-   Time varying parametrisations
-   Test harness for estimators, including scoring metrics.

Estimation

-   Collection of methods for incidence, growth rate, reproduction
    number (and wrappers for existing tools)
-   Poisson count and binomial/multinomial proportion models

Visualization

-   Default `ggplot2` visualisations of epidemic time series, including
    adjustment for population and variable time steps.

# Simulation

## Models:

-   Poisson growth rate (count model)
-   Poisson reproduction number (count model)
-   Branching process model (individual model)
-   SEIR ODE (compartment model)

## Time varying parameters:

-   Rt / growth rate / transmission
-   Importation
-   Generation time
-   Ascertainment
-   Delay to observation, e.g. symptoms, admissions, death
-   Contact matrices
-   Dispersion

## Scoring

-   `mean_quantile_bias` - the average of the universal residuals. Lower
    values are better.
-   `mean_bias` - the bias on the natural scale (which may be
    interpreted as additive or multiplicative depending on the link)
-   `pit_was` - an unadjusted probability integral transform histogram
    Wasserstein distance from the uniform (lower values are better).
-   `unbiased_pit_was` - an PIT Wasserstein distance from the uniform,
    adjusted for estimator bias (lower values are better). This is a
    measure of calibration.
-   `directed_pit_was` - a PIT Wasserstein distance from the uniform,
    directed away from the centre, adjusted for estimator bias (values
    closer to zero are better, positive values indicate overconfidence,
    and negative values excessively conservative estimates).
-   `percent_iqr_coverage` - the percentage of estimators that include
    the true value in their IQR. For a perfectly calibrated estimate
    this should be 0.5. Lower values reflect overconfidence, higher
    values reflect excessively conservative estimates. This is a measure
    of calibration but is influenced by bias.
-   `unbiased_percent_iqr_coverage` - the percentage of estimators that
    include the true value in their IQR once adjusted for bias. This
    should be 0.5. This is a measure of calibration, and tells you which
    direction (smaller numbers are over-confident, larger values
    excessively conservative).
-   `mean_prediction_interval_width_50` - the prediction interval width
    is a measure of sharpness (smaller values are sharper). Sharper
    estimators are superior if they are unbiased and well calibrated.
-   `mean_crps` - the mean value of the continuous rank probability
    score for each point estimate (lower values are better)
-   `threshold_misclassification_probability` - if a metric has a
    natural threshold like 1 for $R_t$ then this measures how probable
    it is that the estimate will propose the epidemic is shrinking when
    it is growing and vice versa. Lower is better.

# Estimation methods

-   Rapid simple estimates.
-   All methods can operate over multiple sub-group time series.
-   Supports daily / weekly / monthly / yearly time series\*
-   Testing estimators against simulations.

## Infectivity profile estimation

-   Estimation of generation time or serial interval from published
    estimates (including uncertainty)
-   Resampled from raw interval data (with bootstrapping for
    uncertainty) from posterior estimates of a fitted gamma distribution

## Poisson rate models

-   Locfit or GLM fitted time varying quasipoisson model.
-   GAM models including adjustment for right censoring.
-   Estimates incidence and growth rate
-   Normalisation per capita population or to population baseline rate

## Binomial proportion models

-   Locfit or GLM fitted time varying quasibinomial model.
-   Estimates proportion and relative growth rate
-   Normalisation against population baseline risk

## Multinomial proportion models

-   `nnet` based multinomial proportion models.

## $R_t$ estimation methods:

### EpiEstim wrapper

Simple adaptor for EpiEstim reference method

### Reimplementation of Cori method

-   Inputs raw incidence time series
-   Reimplementation integrates estimates from a range of time windows
-   Handles missing data.
-   Less lag and more uncertainty.

### Wallinga and Lipsitch growth rates method

-   Inputs an exponential growth rate time series estimate (assumed
    normally distributed)
-   Uses MGF of discrete SI distribution
-   Monte-Carlo resampling for propagation of uncertainty
-   Moderately slow

### $R_t$ from modelled incidence

-   Inputs a log-normally distributed incidence estimate.
-   Propagates uncertainty in infectivity profile and incidence data
-   Deterministic & tolerant of missing values.
-   Can use incidence model derived from weekly count time series.
-   Can deal with negative values in serial interval

### Bootstrapped renewal eqaution

-   Inputs distributional for of incidence estimate.
-   Uses resampling to propagate uncertainty in incidence and
    infectivity profile
-   Non deterministic, can use weekly time-series
