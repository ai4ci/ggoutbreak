\description{
Delayed GAM reporting model function generator
}
\details{
This function is used to configure a delayed reporting GAM model. The model
is of the form:

\code{count ~ s(time, bs = "cr", k = length(kts)) + s(log(tau), k = 4, pc = max_delay)}

where \code{tau} is the difference between time series observation time and the
time of the data point in the time series, and we have multiple observations
of the same time series. This function helps specify the knots of the GAM and
the maximum expected delay
