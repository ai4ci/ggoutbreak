data(england_covid)
}
\description{
A dataset of the daily count of COVID-19 cases by age group in England
downloaded from the UKHSA coronavirus API, and formatted for
use in \code{ggoutbreak}. A denominator is calculated which is the overall
positive count for all age groups. This data set can be used to calculate
group-wise incidence and absolute growth rates and group wise proportions and
relative growth rates by age group.
}
\details{
You may want \code{england_covid_test_positives} instead which includes the
population denominator. The denominator here is the total number of positive
tests across all age groups and not the number of tests taken or population
size.
